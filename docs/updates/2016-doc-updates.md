## Kendo UI Q1 2016

### Changes from Kendo UI Q3 2015

* The conceptual topic documentation on Kendo UI widgets is reorganized to correspond to the structure of the [Kendo UI live demo page](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/). The articles on Kendo UI controls are now listed in the **Widgets** folder. For example, **Widgets** > **Data Management** > **Grid** > **Overview**.
* The new **Styles and Appearance** folder contains the combined articles on the layout and general appearance of the Kendo UI widgets that were previously referred to as Web and DataViz, such as the **Responsive Web Design** and **ThemeBuilder Overview** help topics.
* The recently added **Third-Party Frameworks and Utilities** folder accommodates the articles on Kendo UI integration with third-party frameworks, such as the **TypeScript** and **RequireJS** help topics.
* The newly created **Troubleshooting** folder holds all existing general Kendo UI issues, which are now split into topics, so that a particular issue can be much more easily located. This approach resulted in articles such as **Performance Issues** and **Content Security Policy**.
* The new **Backwards Compatibility** folder contains all Kendo UI breaking changes now divided depending on the year of their release.
* The headings in nearly half of the existing help topics are now shortened and improved with a focus on building a much clearer and easy-to-access internal structure as well as suiting the new web design of the Documentation hub. The work on building a consistent style of inter-linking related topics via the newly-added **See Also** section is going on, too.
