# New Project Wizard

This help topic shows how to create a new Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Application.

The New Project wizard is used for creation of a new Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Application (Telerik | UI for ASP.NET MVC | Create New Telerik Project). The wizard consists of two steps. On the first page the user can specify some project-wide settings while on the second page he can configure the data access layer.

## Project Settings

## Create a New Kendo UI Web Application

When you click 'Finish', the creation of new Kendo UI web application will begin. The wizard will:

- Create new ASP.NET MVC application
- Copy all Kendo UI scripts, including the vsdoc script that enables the VS Intellisense feature (if CDN support is not enabled)
- Copy all Kendo UI content files (if CDN support is not enabled)
- Copy all Kendo UI global resources (optional)
- Copy all Kendo UI editor templates (optional)
- Copy the Kendo UI assembly to your solution folder (optional)
- Add reference to the Kendo.Mvc assembly
- Apply the pre-selected theme
- Create test project (optional)

## Modernize Inclusion

The Kendo UI ASP.NET MVC application includes a custom stripped-down Modernizr in a file called `kendo.modernizr.custom.js`. Its goal is to provide HTML5 element support for old browsers, specifically Internet Explorer.
If you need Modernizr in your application, you may want to remove the existing Modernizr and register another version, which includes more components and features. In this case, if HTML5 element support is required,
make sure that the newly registered Modernizr [provides such support](http://modernizr.com/docs/#html5inie) by including the **html5shiv** component.
