# Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC 6 - RC1
This tutorial shows how to use Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC in ASP.NET MVC 6 applications.

> The ASP.NET 5 Framework is still actively developed. Tooling and APIs change frequently, often requiring extensive changes.
See [Known Issues](known-issues) for up-to-date information.

# Requirements and Supported Environments

We target the stable release of the ASP.NET 5 framework. At the time of this writing this is RC1.

The target runtime is [CoreCLR](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr). The full desktop CLR is also supported.

# ASP.NET Resources

The [ASP.NET 5 Documentation](http://docs.asp.net/en/latest/index.html) is a great place to get started.

These are immensely useful when you need to track down particular issues or behaviors.
